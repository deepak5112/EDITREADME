# # Page Replacement Algorithm

This project demonstrates the implementation of page replacement algorithms in Java. The program simulates page replacement and counts page faults for different memory access patterns.

## Project Structure

- **src/**
  - `Main.java`: The main entry point of the program.
  - `PageReplacement.java`: Contains the logic for page replacement algorithms.

## How to Run the Program

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/deepak5112/
cd project4-521/src
javac Main.java PageReplacement.java

java Main

Enter the number of frames in the physical memory: 3
Number of frames entered: 3
100 page faults are generated for the row-major order array-initialization.
10000 page faults are generated for the column-major order array-initialization.
